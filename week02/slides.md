## Lecture and Activities

### WHAT IS A TEXT EDITOR? 
* A program to open, view, and edit plain text files
* Unlike word processors, text editors DO NOT add formatting to text
* Examples of text editors:
  * Atom
  * Sublime Text
  * Visual Studio Code
*  Use it to write your code! 

### FILES IN A TEXT EDITOR 
- We will be using an online text editor called Replit
- We will be creating HTML, CSS, and JS files 
- We need to know how to correctly specify the file paths to different files in a website’s structure

### FILE PATHS
* Describes the location of the file in a website’s folder structure
* Absolute file path is the full URL to the file
  * https://www.w3schools.com/images/picture.jpg
* Relative file path is the path relative to the current page 
  * images/picture.jpg 
  * This means go to the images folder, then find the image at picture.jpg 
  * data/images/image2.jpg 
  * This means go to the data folder, then the images folder, then find the image at image2.jpg 

### SETTING UP A TEXT EDITOR 
* Today we will set up your Replit accounts
* Please visit replit.com
  * Create a Replit account
  * Assign you to a team
  * Create our index.html, styles.css, and app.js files
  * Link these files together 
  * Display it on a web browser! 

## Project in Breakout Sessions with Mentors
1. Practice linking files and typing correct file paths
