## Lecture and Activities

### WHAT IS JAVASCRIPT?  
* Programming language created by Brendan Eich in 1995 
* Adds functionality and behavior on websites 
  * Insert dynamic text into HTML
  * React to events
  * Perform calculations
* Javascript is not the same as Java
  * JavaScript is to Java as Carpet is to Car 


### VARIABLES 
* Variables are much like buckets holding information
* Contents can change  
* You can store many single data types:
  * Numbers (1, 2.3, 400)
  * Strings (“Preston”)
  * Booleans (true or false)
  * console.log() is a method/function that prints or displays variables or values to the console

### OPERATORS AND IF STATEMENTS
* Assignment operator: =
* Addition operator: +
* Subtraction operator: -
* Multiplication operator: *
* Division operator: /
* Comparison operators
  * Greater than: >
  * Less than: <
  * Equal to: ==
  
<!-- 
### DOM ELEMENTS 
* Often with Javascript, you want to change something on your site. 
* To do so, you have to find the elements first. 
1. Finding HTML elements by id
2. Finding HTML elements by tag name
3. Finding HTML elements by class name
4. Finding HTML elements by CSS selectors
5. Finding HTML elements by HTML object collections

### EVENT LISTENERS
* They allow us to add interactive functionality to HTML elements by “listening” to different events that take place on the page, such as when the user clicks a button, presses a key, or when an element loads. When an event happens, we can do something. -->

## Project in Breakout Sessions with Mentors
* Practice linking files 
* Use Javascript to create a shaper teller! 
* Discuss code or ask questions to your mentors
