## Lecture and Activities

### Review - Visiting A Webpage 
* You want to visit www.website.com by typing the website name in the browser
* The browser will request the HTML for www.website.com from the server
* After the server response, the browser creates DOM of the page by creating JS objects for each HTML element
* Lastly, the browser will render and you will be able to see the contents of www.website.com 

### Review - Building a Website 
* A website is a collection of web pages and resources (images, videos..etc.) 
* Coding allows us to give instructions to the computer to build our website 

### Review - Getting Started
* Open a text editor (Atom, Sublime Text ...etc.) 
* Create index.html, styles.css, and app.js files 
* Link the styles.css and app.js file to the index.html file 
* Code
* View the index.html file on the browser 

### Review - HTML
* HTML is the content of our webpage  
* Elements are basic building blocks of webpages (p, h1, button...etc.) 
* Attributes provide more information about elements (ids, classes, src...etc.) 

### Review - CSS
* CSS provides the style of our webpage  
* CSS selectors specify which elements we want to apply our styles to 
* CSS properties / values specify what styles we want to change 
* We can also create CSS keyframe animations! 

### Review - JS
* JS provides interactiveness to our webpage 
* Variables can store data (numbers, strings, booleans, arrays, objects) 
* If statements allow us to run code conditionally 
* Functions allow us to organize code into reusable parts 
* Arrays allow us to store data associated with a position 
* Objects allow us to store data in key:value pairs 

### Review - DOM
* When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model (DOM) of the page
* The DOM is constructed as a tree of Objects
* The DOM allows us to access HTML elements and change them in JS! 
* When we want to add HTML elements, here are the steps we need to take:
1. Create the HTML element using the .createElement method
2. Append it to an existing element using the .appendChild  method 

### Review - Handling Events
* Events are actions that happen on webpages (e.g. clicks, mouse movement..etc.) 
* We can react to events in different ways 
1. The source. Most sources of an event will be document elements (a button, paragraph, div, header, etc.) Sources can also be the window (the browser window)
2. The event is attached to a source (click, load, mouseover, keypress, etc.)
3. The response happens because of the event. Output or other document elements are changed in the response behavior.

### Review - Debugging
* Console.log to check if your JS is working as expected 
* Check the console (Right click on page -> Inspect -> Look in the console tab) for error messages 
* Check the console on Replit (Upper right hand corner in the Webview tab, click the wrench icon to Toggle Developer Tools)
* Check spelling, capitalization, file paths, extra or missing braces 

### Common Issues 
* Spelling, capitalization, extra or missing braces 
* Linking files 
* Absolute vs relative file paths 
  * Relative file paths: points to a file relative to the current page 
    * images/penguin.png 
  * Absolute file paths: full URL to an internet file 
    * https://dogtime.com/assets/uploads/2018/10/puppies-cover-1280x720.jpg 

### Relative File Paths
* Start from the file you are in
* Indentation = "In" the folder 
* Lets try the example to the right

### Web Hosting
* In order for your website to be available to the public and "live", you need:
* A domain name ("address") 
  * ex. www.mywebsite.com 
* Web host to store your website files on a server ("house")
* Free web hosting options include:
  * Github Pages 
  * Glitch 
 
## FINAL PROJECT SHOWCASE
* Send us your best project (email us the link to your Glitch webpage) by next 
* We will provide comments and feedback, and your project may be featured on our website! 
* Feel free to ask questions via Email or Replit throughout the week
