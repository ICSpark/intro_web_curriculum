## Lecture and Activities

### Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)
- We can change the style of our elements in our HTML file by linking these files together with a link tag
- CSS describes the appearance and layout of information on a web page
- MDN has a great list of CSS properties to look through! Beware, it is a bit long.

```HTML
<head>
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
</head>
```
```CSS
selector {
  property: value;
  property: value;
  ...
  property: value;
}

p {
  color: red;
  font-family: sans-serif;
}
```

### WHAT IS CSS FLEXBOX? 
* A CSS layout model
* Allows us to design web pages with responsive layouts. 
  * Containers expands items with to fill available free space.
  * Prevents overflowing of elements on the web pages.

### CSS FLEXBOX
* HTML elements in CSS Flexbox act as boxes embedded within each other.
* Work from the outside to the inside; biggest to smallest.

### PARENT/CHILD ELEMENTS 
* We refer to elements that contain other elements as parent elements
* The element inside is referred to as a child element

### FLEXBOX FROGGY 
* Flexbox Froggy is a game that allows you to practice flexbox properties.
* The frogs and the lily pads in the pond act just as elements on a web page do.
